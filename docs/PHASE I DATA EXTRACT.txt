TITLE: INSTAGRAM MARKETING ANALYTICS & PERFORMANCE DASHBOARD USING TABLEAU
AUTHOR: AMAL MOHAMED M
BASED ON REAL META (INSTAGRAM) ACCOUNT EXPORT DATA
COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION FROM RAW JSON → DASHBOARD → INSIGHTS

=====================================================================
PHASE 1 – RAW META EXPORT → JSON PROCESSING → CLEAN DATASET PREPARATION

The dataset for this project was taken directly from a real Instagram account by using the official Meta Account Download Tool. After requesting Instagram data, a ZIP file was received containing folders and JSON files. These JSON files were not in Excel/table format — meaning we had to manually extract and process them to make the data usable for analytics.

This phase explains how the exported raw Meta data was transformed step-by-step into a structured dataset suitable for Tableau.

Structure of the Meta Export Received

The downloaded zip contained folders like:

instagram_export/
├─ posts/
├─ media/
├─ likes.json
├─ comments.json
├─ followers/
├─ profile_information.json
├─ saved_content/
├─ stories/
└─ account_history/

Every component of an Instagram post exists separately.
No spreadsheet. No direct summary. Everything is JSON logs.

Example raw JSON for a post:

{
"media_id": "JP3489",
"caption": "New Arrival ✨",
"taken_at": "2024-03-10T17:21:04",
"media_type": "image"
}

Likes stored separately:

{ "media_id": "JP3489", "user": "abc" }

Comments stored separately:

{ "media_id": "JP3489", "text": "Beautiful!" }

This demonstrates why preprocessing is required.
To analyze engagement, we must merge everything under one row per post.

JSON to DataFrame Conversion (Explained Simply)

We loaded the JSON files into Python using Pandas.

import pandas as pd, json

posts = pd.read_json("posts.json")
likes = pd.read_json("likes.json")
comments = pd.read_json("comments.json")

Merging process:

likes_count = likes.groupby("media_id").size().rename("like_count")
comments_count = comments.groupby("media_id").size().rename("comment_count")

posts = posts.merge(likes_count, on="media_id", how="left")
posts = posts.merge(comments_count, on="media_id", how="left")

Timestamps were standardized:

posts["timestamp"] = pd.to_datetime(posts["taken_at"])

Final Dataset Column Structure

The dataset was obtained directly from Meta and prepared for analytics.
The final file used in Tableau contained columns:

post_id
timestamp
caption
media_type (image / reel / carousel)
like_count
comment_count
save_count
share_count
reach
impressions
profile_visits
follows
engagement_rate (calculated later in Tableau)

PHASE-1 RESULT:
A clean, structured Instagram dataset created from raw JSON export, ready for analytics.

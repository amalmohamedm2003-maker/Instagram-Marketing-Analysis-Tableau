## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the performance of a business marketing page on Instagram using post-level data.
The objective is to understand:

- When to post (best days & hours)
- Which formats perform best (Reels, Carousels, Images)
- Which content themes drive engagement and conversions
- How to prioritize posts for paid promotion and higher ROI

I designed an end-to-end Tableau dashboard plus a storytelling view (Tableau Story) that walks stakeholders
from raw performance to final action recommendations.

## 🧾 Dataset

- ~320 Instagram posts
- Columns: timestamp, media_type, caption, likes, comments, saves, shares, reach, impressions,
  profile visits, follows, and derived fields such as engagement, engagement rate, virality score.
- Synthetic but realistic business-marketing behavior shaped to reflect:
  - Weekends and evenings performing better
  - Reels > Carousels > Images in engagement
  - New Drop, Styling/Try-On, Promo content performing strongest

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques

- **Tableau** – Dashboards, story points, forecasting, heatmaps, interactive filters
- **Python** – Data shaping, synthetic behavior tuning, CSV preparation
- **Excel/CSV** – Validation and quick checks
- **SQL (conceptual)** – Thinking in joins/filters and aggregations
- **Statistical Thinking & ML-style Forecasting** – Engagement rate, virality, conversion logic

## 📊 Key Analyses

1. **Best Time to Post**
   - Weekends (Saturday & Sunday) show higher engagement than weekdays
   - Peak window: **7 PM – 11 PM**

2. **Format Performance**
   - **Reels > Carousels > Images** in engagement performance
   - Carousels generate more saves/shares → good for storytelling and product education

3. **Theme Performance**
   - Strongest themes: New Drop/Launch, Styling/Try-On Reels, Sale/Promo content
   - Supporting themes: Behind-The-Scenes, Reviews → help build brand trust

4. **Promotion ROI & Priority**
   - Cost-per-engagement logic used to identify which posts are best to boost
   - Priority Score ranks high-performing posts for paid promotion

- 50% Reels – try-on, styling, lookbooks, dynamic product views

- 20% Images – brand identity, aesthetic shots, simple promos

**Posting Schedule**

- Focus on **Fri–Sun**, especially **19:00–23:00**
